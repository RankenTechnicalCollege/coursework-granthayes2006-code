<p>My favorite musical group would probably be <a href="https://www.milkblood.com/" class="website" target="_blank">MILKBLOOD</a>.</p>

<ul>The people behind it is Pat Morrissey, David Dahlquist, Mike Diva.</ul>

    <dt>VOID</dt>
        <dd>This is one of their first songs. It isn't as good as their newer songs but that makes sense because they were still exploring with their style.</dd>
    <dt>DREAM SLOW</dt>
        <dd>It was really appealing to the ears but also one I listened to the least out of the other ones.</dd>
    <dt>MODULAR</dt>
        <dd>Definitely one of my favorite of their songs. I'm not a music expert nor do I have any experience with music at all so I cant really describe it, but it is really good.</dd>
