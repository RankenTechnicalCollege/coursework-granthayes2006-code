        <p>HTML is an acronym for Hypertext Markup Language.</p>
        <p>You use a text editor to create an HTML page.</p>
        <p>HTML 5.2 is the most up-to-date version of HTML.</p>
        <p>HTML is rendered in internet browsers. Such as, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, Brave, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, and more.</p>
        <p>If I had not corrected these mistakes, the page would still render in a browser however it would not be very pretty as some of the code would appear in the webpage.</p>
